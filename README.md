# Hi, Hola, Bonjour, おはよう 👋

I'm a young web developer but above all a very curious guy with a weird passion for C15 (french grandpa's car 🚐) & food !

## What I'm doing ? 🔥

Curently working at [@p3ol](https://github.com/p3ol) in Bordeaux with some strange but very nice guys ❤️

## What are my skills ? 🤔

I like to qualify myself as a JavaScript adventurer, a React slayer, a NodeJs lover and a bunch of other things that you would'nt expect ... 🧑‍💻

## How to contact me ? 🔮

You can try to send me a homing pigeon or just use the shining but maybe [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-deflesschouwer-6812a0172/) would be an easyer way
